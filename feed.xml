You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <h2 id="images-and-figures">Images and Figures</h2> <p>Its generally a better idea to avoid linking to images hosted elsewhere - links can break and you might face losing important information in your blog post. To include images in your submission in this way, you must do something like the following:</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>which results in the following image:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr-1400.webp"/> <img src="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-distill-example/iclr.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>To ensure that there are no namespace conflicts, you must save your asset to your unique directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/img/2025-04-28-[SUBMISSION NAME]</code> within your submission.</p> <p>Please avoid using the direct markdown method of embedding images; they may not be properly resized.

Note that we will be using plotly for this demo, but anything built off of HTML should work (<strong>no extra javascript is allowed!</strong>). All that’s required is for you to export your figure into HTML format, and make sure that the file exists in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/html/[SUBMISSION NAME]/</code> directory in this repository’s root directory. To embed it into any page, simply insert the following code anywhere into your page.</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% include [FIGURE_NAME].html %}

If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag.

The first paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) can improve the optimization of cis-regulatory DNA sequences, a crucial problem in synthetic biology.

While millions of putative CREs have been identified over the past decade, most are naturally evolved and cover only a small region of the possible sequence space. Therefore, the design of synthetic CREs with <em>desired fitness</em> is a promising direction, with broad applications across diverse domains.</p> <p>The design of high-fitness CREs has primarily relied on <em>directed evolution</em>, which iteratively mutates and selects sequences in wet-lab settings. More recently, <em>fitness prediction models</em> have been utilized as reward models to guide CRE optimization. However, current methods suffer from two limiations:</p> <ul> <li>Although the sequence space is large, they rely on local modifcation of existing or random sequences with iterative optimization, resulting in <em>local optima</em> and <em>low diversity</em>.</li> <li>They generally do not utilize <em>biological prior knowledge</em>.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-key-contributions">📌 Key Contributions</h4> <p>This paper proposes <strong>TACO</strong> (<strong>T</strong>FBS-<strong>A</strong>ware <strong>C</strong>is-regulatory element <strong>O</strong>ptimization), a RL fine-tuning method for a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) DNA model incorporating biological priors of TFBS information to improve CRE optimization.

In <em>Opinion as an RL Researcher</em>, I share my thoughts from the viewpoint of a RL researcher. <em>Thoughts on Future Research</em> proposes several potential directions for future work inspired by this paper. Lastly, I present what I personally gained from this paper in <em>Personal Takeaways</em>.</p> <h4 id="-strengths">📌 Strengths</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Novelty of TFBS Reward</strong>: TACO incorporates TFBS motif information as biological prior knowledge into TFBS rewards, and is one of the first method leveraging such information in machine learning-based CRE design. Furthermore, the suggested TFBS reward is surrogate-agnostic.</li> <li><strong>Novelty of RL-based CRE design</strong>: Unlike prior optimization-based methods, the authors introduced RL with pre-training AR for CRE, which provides a new paradigm in this domain.</li> <li><strong>Comprehensive Design of the Method</strong>: The overall design of method is comprehensive, and each component is modularied and well-integrated.</li> <li><strong>Empirical Validation</strong>: The authors validated the effectiveness of TACO across different settings and datasets, where TACO achieves both high fitness and diversity compared to baselines.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-weaknesses-limitations-and-critique">📌 Weaknesses, Limitations and Critique</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Presentation and Clarity</strong>: There are several typos throughout the paper. And I found few parts are unclear to understand. The writing would be would be improved.</li> <li><strong>Missing Analysis on Emb Similarity</strong>: While the authors introduced <em>Emb Similarity</em> as an additional metric in offline MBO experiment, they do not provide explanation or justification on this metric. The Emb Similarity is very high compared to baselines, and this tendency is observed across datasets and difficulties as shown in the tables in appendix of the paper. This raises doubts whether TACO truly generate diverse sequences.</li> <li><strong>Limitation of TFBS Reward</strong>: While the integration of biological priors as TFBS reward is novel, TFBS reward is only based on TFBS frequency and SHAP values. This simple structure does not consider other factors such as interactions between TFs and their orientation which can impact their regulatory roles <d-cite key="georgakopoulos2023transcription"></d-cite>. Moreover, the current method relied on a fixed TFBS databse, which may set an upper limit of the TFBS reward.</li> <li><strong>Necessity of RL Pipeline</strong>: The overall pipeline is quite complex as it includes diverse factors such as AR pre-training, RL fine-tuning, and TFBS rewards with SHAP values. Morevover, auxiliary techniques, such as hill climing replay buffers, are employed. While TACO demonstrated its effectiveness, it is questionable whether the benefits of using this pipeline justify its complexity. Other baselines seems to be easier to implement and to utilize.</li> <li><strong>No Analysis on Computational Cost</strong>: Related to the previous point, there is no analysis on computational cost. This would help to better understand TACO or to justify its use.</li> <li><strong>Dependency on Learned Reward Model</strong>: As all rewards are obtained from learned reward models, the performance is hightly sensitive to the quality of these reward models.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-opinion-as-an-rl-researcher">📌 Opinion as an RL Researcher</h4> <ul> <li>The authors say that TACO is an RL method for CRE design. Let us revisit this.<br/> While TACO is not a complete offline RL method, it lacks the typical <em>environment</em> in RL and interactions with the environment. In RL, an environment consists of its dynamics (a state transition function) and reward function. However, in TACO, there is no dynamics and policy itself just expands the sequence, i.e., the transition is deterministic. Only rewards are obtained from the separately trained reward models. Thus, we can view TACO as an RL-inspired optimization method.</li> <li>TACO overlaps with various areas of RL, while not perfectly aligned with any one of them. <ul> <li>Model-based RL: Utilize learned reward models, but no dynamics.</li> <li>Offline RL: Pre-train the policy with offline data, but also employ external reward models.</li> <li>On-Policy and Off-Policy RL: TACO uses REINFORCE, an on-policy algorithm, while also employing a replay buffer is off-policy RL.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The construction of TFBS reawrd is a case of <em>reward shaping</em>. Reward shaping provides a way to reflect the domain knowledge and to improve training. However, such shaping is difficult in general. If one wants to integrate further domain knowledge in the current TFBS reward, this process would not be trivial. Furthermore, the shaped reward can results in overfitting, which requires careful consideration.</li> <li>The authors noted that they employ REINFORCE as an RL fine-tuning algorithm following the previous work in molecule optimization. However, there are other advanced options like PPO. While REINFORCE is relatively simple and shows effectiveness with additional auxiliary techniques, using REINFORCE lacks justification.</li> <li>Nevertheless, this work is encouraing as RL techniques demonstrated the potential in real-world applications beyond typical RL simulation benchmarks.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-thoughts-on-future-work">📌 Thoughts on Future Work</h4> <ul> <li>Further development of TFBS reward would be interesting. As noted in the paper, exploring data-driven motif mining or explicitly incorporating factors such as interactions between TFs to model more complex TF activities could be promising directions.</li> <li>One can extend the pipeline of TACO to other protein design tasks and validate its generalization ability. Or, one can extend TACO to multi-objective (in addition to fitness) optimization.</li> <li>Validation in wet-lab setting over simulation-based evaluation would be important. But this is beyond the scope of AI researchers.</li> <li>RL techniques could be futher adjusted or newly adopted for TACO.

Despite their differences, many of these generative models share a common property: starting from easy-to-sample distribution, they iteratively contruct the sample \(X_{t+h}\) of the next time step depeding only on the current state \(X_t\), i.e., they are <strong>Markov processes</strong>.</p> <p>Then, can we design a unified framework for these generative modeling methods?</p> <h4 id="-key-contribution">📌 Key Contribution</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Unified Framework for Generative Modeling</strong>: This paper proposes <strong>Generator Matching (GM)</strong>, a framework for generative modeling with Markov processes on arbitrary state spaces.

This can be done by transforming a simple distribution \(p_{\text{simple}}\) into \(p_{\text{data}}\) via probability paths. First sample \(z \sim p_{\text{data}}\) and sample \(x \sim p_t(dx\vert z)\) from <strong>conditional probability path</strong>, a set of time-varying probability distributions \((p_t(dx\vert z))_{0 \leq t \leq 1}\). Then we can construct <strong>marginal probability path</strong> which interpolates between \(p_{\text{simple}}\) and \(p_{\text{data}}\):</p> \[z \sim p_{\text{data}}, \quad x \sim p_t(dx|z) \Rightarrow x \sim p_t(dx)\] <p>Now, the first design principle of GM follows:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Principle 1</strong><br/> Given a data distribution \(p_{\text{data}}\), choose \(p_{\text{simple}}\) and a conditional probability path such that the marginal path \((p_t)_{0 \leq t \leq 1}\) fulfills \(p_0 = p_{_\text{simple}}\) and \(p_1 = p_{\text{data}}\).</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="-as-a-markov-process">📌 As a Markov Process</h4> <p>We can view generative models as <strong>Markov Processes</strong> <d-cite key="ethier2009markov"></d-cite>. What are Markov Processes? They satisfy the Markov property: the next state depends only on the current state. Mathematically, a time-continuous Markov process is \((X_t)_{0 \leq t \leq 1}\) for \(t \in [0, 1]\) and a random variable \(X_t \in S\), satisfying</p> \[P[X_{t_{n+1}} \in A \mid X_{t_1}, X_{t_2}, \ldots, X_{t_n}] = P[X_{t_{n+1}} \in A \mid X_{t_n}]\] <p>for all \(0 \leq t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_n &lt; t_{n+1} \leq 1\) and measurable set \(A \subseteq S\). For each Markov Process, a corresponding <strong>transition kernel</strong> \((k_{t+h \mid t})_{0 \leq t &lt; t+h \leq 1}\) assigns \(x \in S\) a probability distribution \(P[X_{t+h} \in A \mid X_t = x] = k_{t+h \mid t}(A \mid x)\).</p> <p>With a Markov Process, we can generate data samples from \(p_{\text{data}}\) following a marginal probability path \((p_t(dx))_{0 \leq t \leq 1}\): sample \(X_0 \sim p_0\) and simulate \(X_{t+h} \sim k_{t+h \mid t}(\cdot \mid X_t)\) step-wise up to \(t = 1\). However, an abitrary general kernel \(k_{t+h \mid t}\) is difficult to parameterize in a neural network. In diffusion models, the kernel can be closely approximated by simple parametric distributions such as Gaussians for small \(h&gt;0\) <d-cite key="sohl2015deep"></d-cite><d-cite key="ho2020denoising"></d-cite> . This idea can be extended to Markov processes, leading to the <em>generator</em>.</p> <h3 id="part-2-generator">Part 2: Generator</h3> <h4 id="-concept-of-generator">📌 Concept of Generator</h4> <p>Now, what is a generator? For \(k_{t+h \mid t}\) with small \(h&gt;0\), below is an informal version of 1st-order Taylor approximation in \(t\) with an error term \(o(h)\).</p> \[k_{t+h|t} = k_{t|t} + h L_t + o(h), \quad L_t := \left. \frac{d}{dh} \right|_{h=0} k_{t+h|t}, \quad k_{t|t}(\cdot|x) = \delta_x\] <p>The first-order <em>linear</em> approximation \(L_t\) is called <strong>generator</strong> of the kernel \(k_{t+h \mid t}\) <d-cite key="ethier2009markov"></d-cite><d-cite key="ruschendorf2016comparison"></d-cite>. The generator is the core concept of GM, and it will be shown that generative models (such as Diffusion) can be viewed as learning the generator of a Markov process.</p> <p>The problem here is that a probability measure is not a standard function, thus the above equation is not well-defined. Hence, <em>test functions</em> \(f : S \to \mathbb{R}\) are employed to probe probability distributions and to define generator. The actions of marignal \(p_t\) and kernel \(k_{t+h \mid t}\) are defined for all \(f \in \mathcal{T}\) with the linear function:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \langle p_t, f \rangle &amp;\overset{\text{def}}{=} \int f(x)\, p_t(dx) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_t}[f(x)] \quad \text{(Marginal Action)} \\ \langle k_{t+h\mid t}, f \rangle(x) &amp;\overset{\text{def}}{=} \langle k_{t+h\mid t}(\cdot\mid x), f \rangle = \mathbb{E}[f(X_{t+h}) \mid X_t = x] \quad \text{(Transition Action)} \end{aligned}\] <p>Now we can define the generator with these actions.</p> <h4 id="-definition-of-generator">📌 Definition of Generator</h4> <p>Consider the earlier <em>informal</em> Taylor approximation. With test functions and the actions, we can take derivatives of \(\langle k_{t+h \mid t}, f \rangle(x)\) per \(x \in S\):</p> \[\left. \frac{d}{dh} \right|_{h=0} \langle k_{t+h|t}, f \rangle(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\langle k_{t+h|t}, f \rangle(x) - f(x)}{h} \overset{\text{def}}{=} [L_t f](x)\] <p>This action is defined as the <strong>generator</strong> \(L_t\). Moreover, the informal Taylor approximation is now well-defined as \(\langle k_{t+h \mid t}, f \rangle = f + h L_t f + o(h)\).</p> <p>Under mild regularity assumptions, there is a unique correspondence between the Markov process and the generator <d-cite key="ethier2009markov"></d-cite><d-cite key="pazy2012semigroups"></d-cite>. Thus, we can parameterize a Markov process via a parameterized generator \(L_t^\theta\). However, directly parameterizing a linear operator \(L_t\) on function spaces with a neural network is difficult. Hence, restrict ourselves to certain subclasses of Markov processes <d-footnote> Flow matching restricts itself to generators $ L_t f = \nabla f(x)^\top u^\theta_t(x) $. </d-footnote>, and parameterize it linearly via a neural network. The following theorem characterizes generators.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Theorem 1 (Universal characterization of generators)</strong><br/> Under regularity assumptions <d-footnote> Refer Appendix A.2 in the paper. </d-footnote>, the generators of a Markov processes \(X_t\ (0 \leq t \leq 1)\) take the form:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Discrete</strong> \((|S| &lt; \infty)\): The generator is given by a rate transition matrix \(Q_t\) and the Markov process corresponds to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC).</li> <li><strong>Euclidean space</strong> \((S = \mathbb{R}^d)\): The generator has a representation as a sum<br/> \(L_t f(x) = \underbrace{\nabla f(x)^\top u_t(x)}_{\text{flow}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 f(x) \cdot \sigma_t^2(x)}_{\text{diffusion}} + \underbrace{\int [f(y) - f(x)] Q_t(dy; x)}_{\text{jump}}\) where \(u: [0,1] \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d\) is a <strong>velocity field</strong>, \(\sigma: [0,1] \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow S^{++}_d\) is the <strong>diffusion coefficient</strong> (\(S^{++}_d =\) positive semi-definite matrices), and \(Q_t(A\mid x)\) is a finite measure called <strong>jump measure</strong>. \(\nabla^2 f(x)\) denotes the Hessian of \(f\) and \(\nabla^2 f(x) \cdot \sigma_t^2(x)\) describes the Frobenius inner product.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>Theorem 1 characterizes a wide class of Markov process models as well as the design space <em>exhaustively</em> for \(S = \mathbb{R}^d\) or \(S\) discrete. Now we have the second principle:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Principle 2</strong><br/> Parameterize a Markov process via a parameterized generator \(L_t^\theta\). For \(S = \mathbb{R}^d\), pameterize a Markov process (e.g., using a neural network) via a generator \(L_t\) that is composed of (a subset of) velocity \(u_t\), diffusion coefficient \(\sigma_t^ 2\), and jump measure \(Q_t\).</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="-kolmogorov-forward-equation-and-marginal-generator">📌 Kolmogorov Forward Equation and Marginal Generator</h4> <p>The generator can not only parameterize a Markov Process, but also can check if a Markov process generates a desired probability path \(p_t\). The latter is possible via <strong>Kolmogorov Forward Equation (KFE)</strong></p> \[\partial_t \langle p_t, f \rangle = \langle p_t, L_t f \rangle\] <p>which is derived as \(\partial_t \langle p_t, f \rangle = \left.\frac{d}{dh} \right|_{h=0} \langle p_{t+h}, f \rangle = \langle p_t, L_t f \rangle\) <d-footnote> $\langle p_t, \cdot \rangle$ operation is linear to swap the derivative, and the $\langle p_t, \langle k_{t+h|t}, f \rangle \rangle = \langle p_{t+h}, f \rangle$.</d-footnote> . KFE means, for a generator \(L_t\) of a Markov process \(X_t\), we are possible to reconstruct its marginal probabilities via their infinitesimal changes. Conversely, if a generator \(L_t\) of a Markov process \(X_t\) satisfies KFE, \(X_t\) generates the probability path \((p_t)_{0 \leq t \leq 1}\) <d-cite key="rogers2000diffusions"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Now, the key challenge of GM is <strong><em>Given a marginal probability path \((p_t)_{0 \leq t \leq 1}\), find a generator satisfying the KFE</em></strong>. However, the marginal path and a generator for the marginal path (<strong>marginal generator</strong>) are generally unknown or intractable. Let us assume we found a generator \(L_t^z\) the generates \(p_t(\cdot \mid z)\) for every \(z \in S\). This \(L_t^z\) is called <strong>conditional generator</strong>, and we construct marginal generator with \(L_t^z\), i.e., generates a marginal path \(p_t\) with conditional path \(p_t(\cdot \mid z)\).</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Proposition 1</strong><br/> The marginal probability path \((p_t)_{0 \leq t \leq 1}\) is generated by a Markov process \(X_t\) with generator</p> \[L_t f(x) = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{1|t}(\cdot|x)} [L_t^z f(x)]\] <p>where \(p_{1 \mid t}(dz \mid x)\) is the posterior distribution (i.e., the conditional distribution over data \(z\) given an observation \(x\)). For \(S = \mathbb{R}^d\) and the representation in eq. <strong>Theorem 1</strong>, we get a marginal representation of \(L_t f(x)\) given by:</p> \[\begin{aligned} &amp; \nabla f(x)^\top \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{1|t}(\cdot|x)} [u_t(x|z)] + \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 f(x) \cdot \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{1|t}(\cdot|x)} [\sigma_t^2(x|z)] \\ &amp; + \int [f(y) - f(x)] \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{1|t}(\cdot|x)} [Q_t(dy;x|z)] \end{aligned}\] <p>Generally, the above identity holds for any linear parameterization of the generator. <d-footnote> Refer Appendix A.6 in the paper. </d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Following Proposition 1, we have the third principle:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Principle 3</strong> <br/> Derive a conditional generator \(L_t^z\) satisfying the KFE for the conditional path \(p_t(\cdot|z)\).</p> </blockquote> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-20205266/GM-path-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-20205266/GM-path-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-20205266/GM-path-1400.webp"/> <img src="/ai810-gdl/assets/img/2025-04-28-20205266/GM-path.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Markov models trained with different KFE solutions for the same probability path. </div> <p>An important fact is that multiple Markov processes can follow the same probability path, satisfying the same KFE.

The left table corresponds to aspects 1 and 2, while the right table corresponds to aspect 3. </div> <p>As the design space of the GM framework is large and single classes of models (such as diffusion and flows) have already been optimized in prior works, the experiments focues on three aspects of GM.</p> <h4 id="-aspect-1-jump-models-as-a-novel-model-class">📌 Aspect 1. Jump Models as a novel model class</h4> <p>The left table shows FID scores of image generation for CIFAR10 and ImagetNet32. <d-footnote> Since jump models do not have an equivalent of classifier-free guidance yet, the experiment focus on unconditional generation. </d-footnote> Euler and 2nd order denote Euler sampling and ODE sampler, respectively. While the jump model underperforms compared to the current SOTA models, it shows promising results as a first version of an unexplored class of models.</p> <h4 id="-aspect-2-combining-different-model-classes-markov-superposition">📌 Aspect 2. Combining different model classes (Markov superposition)</h4> <p>Firstly, train a flow and jump model in the same architecture, and validate that the flow part adhives the SOTA performance as before. Then combine both models using a Markov superposition (MS in the left table denotes Markov superposition). Markov superposition significantly improves the performance for Euler sampling. Furthermore, combining 2nd order samplers for flow with Euler sampling for jumps in a <em>mixed</em> sampling outperforms the SOTA flow models. This may futher enhanced by improving the jump model.</p> <h4 id="-aspect-3-multimodal-state-spaces">📌 Aspect 3. Multimodal State Spaces</h4> <p>Next, evaluate the GM’s ability to design models for arbitrary and complex state spaces with protein generation tasks. Derive \(L_t^z\) to the KFE on \(S=SO(3)\) with a jump model. Then use Proposition 4 to make it multi-dimensional and combine it with a flow model on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) and a discrete Markov model on \(\{1, \ldots, n\}^d\) for \(n=20\) (# amino acids). The state space becomes \(\mathbb{R}^d \times SO(3)^d \times \{1, \ldots, n\}^d\). Without re-training or fine-tuning the pre-trained MultiFlow <d-cite key="campbell2024generative"></d-cite>, the SOTA model, <em>pseudo-marginalize</em> the conditional jumps by predicting \(x \in SE(3)\) and then taking a conditional setp with \(L_t^z\). The right table shows the results, where the metrics Div and Nov represent diversity and novelty, respectively. Both sequence and structure spaces are sampled jointly in multimodal setting, while only the structure is sampled in unimodal setting. Including a jump model achieves SOTA results without re-training or fine-tuning MultiFlow.</p> <h3 id="personal-analysis-and-commentary-1">Personal Analysis and Commentary</h3> <p>As before, I present comments and evaluations on the paper from general viewpoint in <em>Strengths</em> and <em>Weaknesses, Limitations and Critique</em>. In <em>Opinion as an RL Researcher</em>, I provide my thoughts in perspective of a RL researcher. Then I propose potential directions for future work inspired by this paper in <em>Thoughts on Future Research</em>. Finally, I present what I personally gained from this paper in <em>Personal Takeaways</em>.</p> <h4 id="-strengths-1">📌 Strengths</h4> <p>I present the strengths of this paper including key contributions mentioned earlier:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>A Unified Generative Modeling Framework</strong>: GM is a unified framework of generative modeling via the concept of generator with Markov processes. This GM frameowrk is modality-agnostic and encompasses various existing generative models such as Diffusion models. While there have been pr works for unifying generative models, I believe this unified framework offers a comprehensive view for people working on generative models.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Theretical Foundation</strong>: This work provides comprehensive and rigorous theoretical foundation, grounded in probabilistic process theory. The authors offers solid mathematical details, derivations, and proofs throughout the paper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Recipes to Combine Models</strong>: Using GM framework, we can combine different Markov processes and further extned to multimodal models. These recipes are useful and provide a way to construct diverse generative classes of Markov processes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Novel Models</strong>: This paper introduced a jump model based on jump processes. It takes a novel approach rather than prior flow or diffusion-based methods. While the authors does not highlight, I think the <em>pure diffusion</em> model proposed in this paper is also novel and intersting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Experimental Validation</strong>: The authors validated the effectiveness of GM through several experiments. This can be addressed more comprehensively, but I think it is enough to support GM as the main contribution of this paper is theoretically-grounded unified framework.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="-weaknesses-limitations-and-critique-1">📌 Weaknesses, Limitations and Critique</h4> <p>While I believe this work is remarkable and provides strong contributions, I present some critique here.</p> <ul> <li>While I acknowledge the overall experimental setup and scope is enough as the main contribution is theoretically grounded framework, some experimental results are questionable. While the authors state the jump model shows promising results in the image generation task, it significantly underperforms baselines.</li> <li>Related to the previous point, the jump model need more improvements. For example, sampling methods of jump models are less optimized. Moreover, its effectivenss and stability should be validated further.</li> <li>Practical aspects, sucha as the computational cost of learning and utilizing generators, need to be addressed.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-opinion-as-an-rl-researcher-1">📌 Opinion as an RL Researcher</h4> <ul> <li> <p>A fundamental framework of RL is <em>Markov Decision Process</em>, which is also based on Markov property. GM unifies generative modeling via Markov Process. In RL perspective, this can be viewed as action-marginalized dynamics (transitions).</p> </li> <li>Recently, generative models such as diffusion models are utilized as a planner like model-based RL <d-cite key="janner2022planning"></d-cite>. As shown in GM paper, the diffusion model is an example of GM. And we can combine differnt Markov processes in GM framework. When I became aware of this, I came up with the following idea: <ul> <li>Combine multiple diffsion-based planners to construct a multimodal planner</li> <li>Or, combine planners with different or complementary inductive biases This could be a very intersting research direction.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Bregman divergence was also intersting. As it generalizes many losses inclduing MSE and KL divergence, I think it can be also employed for RL training objectives.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-thoughts-on-future-work-1">📌 Thoughts on Future Work</h4> <ul> <li>Investigating the pure diffusion models introduced in this paper, which learns a diffusion coefficient, would be an interseting direction.</li> <li>Further study of jump models on Euclidiean space could lead to a large class of generative models.</li> <li>We can dive into devlopment of better samplers for jump models.</li> <li>Exploring how GM framework and generators can be employed as a planner for RL would be a promising direction.</li> <li>As GM and jump models are evaluated in two domains, empirical investigation in other domains would be also intersting.</li> </ul> <h4 id="-personal-takeaways-1">📌 Personal Takeaways</h4> <p>I’m not an expert in generative models. During reading this paper, I gained a comprehensive overview of recent generative models such as diffusion and flow models. The shared Markovian view between generative models and RL was also intersting. Furthermore, I got a promising research idea of combining models to construct RL planners.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In this blogpost, I reviewed two papers on generative models. The first paper TACO leverages RL for CRE design, and the second paper provides a unified framework via generator of Markov processes for generative modeling. After addressing the key points of each paper, I presented an interpretation as an RL researcher.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yongsik Lee</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blogpost, I review two recent papers related to generative modeling in a viewpoint of a RL researcher.]]></summary></entry></feed>
